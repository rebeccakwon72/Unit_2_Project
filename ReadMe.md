##  02.5 Do Now Debugging

### Instructions:
  This student is trying to make an `<img>` tag but it's not showing up on the page when they hit "Run"! Take a look at line 14 of their HTML and try to fix their error. (Hint: Look at your work from last class. What is their `<img>` tag missing?)

(Hint #2: What needs to go after the `src` attribute?)

**Finish early?**: 
Create an `<a>` tag that links to one of your favorite websites.
